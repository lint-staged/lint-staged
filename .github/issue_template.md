### Description

<!--
If this is a feature request, explain why it should be added. Specific
use-cases are best.

of `lint-staged`. Furthermore, please provide as much *relevant* info as
possible. Including what is the expected and actual behavior.
-->

### Steps to reproduce

<!-- Tell us how to reproduce this issue. -->

### Debug Logs

<!--
Run `lint-staged` in debug mode using the command line flag `--debug`. You can
either modify your pre-commit script/command to include the flag or invoke
`lint-staged` manually(`npx lint-staged --debug`). Read more
about debug mode here: https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged#--debug.

Without debug logs, it's difficult to provide any help.
