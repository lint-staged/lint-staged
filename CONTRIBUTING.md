# Contributing

## Issues

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome. However, _lint-staged_ should stay as a simple tool, and most complex behavior can already be achieved by running custom scripts via _lint-staged_. Please use the issue template and fill in all sections, including debug logs for bugs.

## Pull Requests

> [!ALERT]  
> Pull requests are not accepted by default!

If you want to contribute code, please open an issue first to discuss the change with the maintainer. Pull requests opened without prior agreement will be closed without consideration.
